# Bomb Scoring System
Bomb Scoring is a system that functions to determine whether a bomb falls on a target or not. In this brief explanation, I want to explain several sections:

- References
- Methodology
- Discussion
- Results and Conclusions.

<h2>Reference</h2>
In this system I used 4-point correspondence [Hartley2004] , Hough Transform for circle detection [Yuen90], and Background Subtraction Mixture of Gaussian 2 (MOG2) [Zivkovic2004, Zivkovic2006].

<h3>4-Point Correspondence</h3>

<h3>Hough Transform for Circle Detection</h3>

<h3>Background Subtraction</h3>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

First, I used 4-point correspondence for choose 4 point in image reference and image camera.

Second, I used Hough Transform to detect target position and radius.

Third, I used Background Subtraction for remove a background that is target object. And I want to detect different in the background target object.

Final, I used Hough transform again in the image tranform after remove background Subtraction for detect bomb in the image and measure the radius and angle from the target.

<h2>Discussion</h2>
In this simulation I used camera PS3 for detection target and bombs. I use a miniature tower as high as 15 centimeters. The distance of the tower to the center of the target is 50 centimeters. In the simulation, approximately 1 centimeter is equal to 1 meter.
