# Bomb Scoring System
Bomb Scoring is a system that functions to determine whether a bomb falls on a target or not. In this brief explanation, I want to explain several sections:

- References
- Methodology
- Discussion
- Results and Conclusions.

<h2>Reference</h2>
In this system I used 4-point correspondence [Hartley] , Hough Transform for circle detection [Yuen90], and Background Subtraction.
